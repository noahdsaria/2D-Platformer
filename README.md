# 2D-Platformer

## Overview
A 2D Platformer Game built using C++ and the Raylib game library to develop my skills in C++ and learn the basics of game development without the aid of a dedicated engine. This is a solo project with the intent of developing a rough prototype/demo game based on 2D platform movement & mechanics.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand what a Game loop is and how to set it up via Raylib
2. Draw, render, and animate 2D-pixel sprites via sprite sheets
3. Implement physics and logic behind horizontal and vertical movement in 2D
